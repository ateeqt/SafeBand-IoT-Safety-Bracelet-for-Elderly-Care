# SafeBand: IoT Safety Bracelet for Elderly Care

## Description

SafeBand is an IoT-powered wearable device designed to enhance the safety of elderly individuals by detecting falls and providing automatic emergency assistance. The bracelet leverages accelerometer sensors to identify falls and alerts emergency services by sending the userâ€™s GPS location. It also includes a manual emergency button for immediate help requests.

This project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being and Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, by promoting health and safety for elderly individuals and fostering innovation in the healthcare industry.


## Features

- **Fall Detection**: Detects falls using accelerometer data and sends alerts.
- **GPS Tracking**: Provides real-time GPS location to emergency services for accurate assistance.
- **Emergency Button**: Allows users to manually request help by pressing a button.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends immediate notifications to emergency contacts and services.
